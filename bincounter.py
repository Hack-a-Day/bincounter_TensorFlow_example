# bincounter - Binary counter implemented as a neural network using the
# TensorFlow framework.
#
# Given binary 000, outputs 001. Given 001, outputs 010, ...
# and given 111, outputs 000. i.e. It knows how to count in binary.
# For even more fun, give it 000 as input the first time, and then every
# subsequent time just use the output of # the previous run as the input of
# the next run.
#
# This is implemented using a two layer, fully connected neural network.
#
# IMPORTANT
# By default this will not save the trained neural network. To save it
# after training, see the variables just below these header comments.
# The same applies if you want to write info for use with TensorBoard.
